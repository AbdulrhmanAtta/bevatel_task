**Shopify Web Developer Task Solution**

This repository contains the solution for the Shopify Web Developer task. The task involved three different challenges related to array manipulation and word value calculation. The solution was implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

***Installation and Setup
To run the solution, follow the steps below:***

1.Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.Open the project in Visual Studio Code or any other code editor.
3.Start a local server to run the website. You can use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or any other server of your choice.
4.Access the website by opening the browser and entering the server's URL.


****Task #1:** Refactoring an Array without Duplicates and Sorting**

In this task, we were given an array of numbers with duplicates. The goal was to refactor the array to remove duplicate numbers and sort it in ascending order. The solution used the Set data structure to eliminate duplicates and the sort() method to sort the resulting array.

****Task #2:** Refactoring an Array with Missing Numbers and Sorting**

For this task, we had an array of numbers without duplicates but with some missing numbers. The objective was to refactor the array by filling in the missing numbers and sorting it in ascending order. The solution involved iterating through the range of numbers, checking for missing values, and pushing them into the array. Finally, the array was sorted using the sort() method.

****Task #3:** Word Value Calculation**

In Task #3, we were tasked with calculating the value of a word based on the alphabetic charts where A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on. The solution implemented a function that iterated through each character of the word, obtained its corresponding value, and accumulated the total word value. The calculated word values for the provided words "Bevatel" and "Backend" were also included in the solution.

**Additional Notes**

The solution leveraged various resources such as GeeksforGeeks and CodePen to address specific challenges and implement the desired functionality.
The code is well-documented with comments to explain the algorithm flow and provide clarity on the implementation details.
